  "The last personal computing revolution brought computers in every pocket. The next personal computing revolution will bring computing devices everywhere and it will be enabled by an Operating System which manages these hardware resources and provides a framework in which applications can be developed. However, the resources and applications managed by this new OS will not be embedded in a single device like our smartphones.",
  "The next personal computing revolution will not be about a more powerful and general purpose device, it will be about trillions of single purpose, always connected and ubiquitous devices. The goal of the OS of the future is to turn what would be many standalone IoT devices into a network of devices acting as different I/O peripherals of a single ubiquitous computer.",
  "Omnia wants to be the operating system enabling the next personal computing revolution and the platform on top of which new kinds of applications will be developed.",
  "As the devices we use to interact with the digital world start disappearing into the fabric of our physical environments, they will specialize into particular input or output peripherals. With Omnia, any sensor becomes an input peripheral capable of sending data to the applications that need it, while any actuator becomes an output device capable of being controlled by such applications. This way, applications will be able to sense the user’s environment and understand its context, so that they can provide a service tailored to its preferences and modify the environment as the user wants.",
  "An example of such applications is one which enables you to share the screen of your computer on the closest display. You can test a simplified version of this app yourself:"
